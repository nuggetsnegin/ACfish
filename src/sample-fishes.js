They have good jumping abilities, which allow them to jump up and grab bugs hanging around the water. They are known as very active fish with rather scrappy attitudes, making them tenacious survivors. During mating season, the males stomach turns pink and its back turns blue. Females love this.',

      'Crucian carp are fairly easy fish for beginners to catch, but they are also popular with veteran anglers. They are related to koi and can live up to 15 years, making them a great fish to keep in a pond. Male offspring are seldom born, so females significantly outnumber males, making populations suffer. Luckily, females reproduce with males of some other species, so the problem is relatively temporary.',

They can swim at only three mph, so although they are large and very imposing, they are not really a threat. They swim with their mouths open to swallow vast quantities of tiny creatures and sea water. As they expel the water through their gills, they will eat what then remains. Since they do not have to bite prey their teeth are file-like and number about 10,000 in multiple rows.',

Combining this great size with their good flavor makes them literally the biggest catch for most anglers. Tuna cannot breathe when they are not moving, so their entire lives revolve around constantly swimming. To sleep, they merely slow down. This ability to swim while sleeping is a huge advantage. They are also rather fast, capable of beating both sets of fins so hard they reach speeds of 50 mph.',
